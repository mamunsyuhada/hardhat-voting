# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run ignition/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## Deployed Smart Contract on Sepolia Testnet

You can view the smart contract details on Sepolia Etherscan:
